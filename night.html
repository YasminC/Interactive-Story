        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>What even is this? </h2>
        <p>Once upon a time I was travelling on a coach; with a gruelling 3 hours left I was already uncomfortably clammy from the (unusually) hot English weather. While a loved-up couple cuddled within the seats behind me, kicking my chair every now and then, I knew that sleep was not an option. I looked up towards the sun with it's burning rays and wished for a moment that it would just leave me alone! That's when my brain went on a frazzled tangent and came up with the odd question; what if the sun is just trying to be my friend because he's lonely? But of course that would be obsurd, even if the Sun did want a friend, it would set me on fire as soon as it got close! So who could befriend a Sun?... A demon!</p>
        <p>Being a developer I couldn't help but turn this short story into a fun and digital project for whatever little spare time I had to fill.</p>
        <h4>Enjoy! </h4>

        <h1>The Sun and the Demon</h1>
        <p>The Sun was lonely. He just wanted a friend, someone to talk to. But whenever he got close to someone he burnt themand he was constantly being told off for not being in the right place at the right time.</p>
        <p>But one day he saw a peculiar figure emerge from a volcano. This figure looked very much like a normal person but with darkened skin and a little tail that peeped out over its trousers.</p>
        <p>Intrigued, the Sun left his designated spot in the sky and went down to see who this was.</p></div>

        <p>"Hello" Said the Sun when he reached this mysterious figure.</p>
        <p>To his suprise the figure didn't scream in scorching agony, instead he simply said, "Hello".</p>
        <p>They both stared at eachother for a while, both not used to much social interaction.</p>
        <p>"If you don't mind me asking" The Sun began, "what exactly are you? It's just that most people start to burn when I get so close to them."</p>
        <p>"I'm a demon" The figure answered plainly.</p>
        <p>"Oh." The Sun gathered his thoughts for a moment. He'd never seen a demon in the flesh before, only heard about them in stories. "Shouldn't you be down there?" The Sun gestured to the ground. "You might get in trouble up here."</p>
        <p>The Demon's face scrunched up in worry and it's fair fell to expose to small horns. "Please don't send me back there..."</p></div>

        <p>"It's not nice you know. All the other kids think it's so cool, playing in the fire pits and getting their own way through violence. I can't stand it anymore! I'll never be the black-hearted demon they want me to be, no matter how many times they force me to watch sacrifices or feed me human guts!"</p>
        <p>The Sun recoiled in horror.</p>
        <p>"I'm sorry, please don't leave! My point is, I'm not like them. I know it and they know it."</p>
        <p>The Sun puzzled over what to do next, this Demon didn't seem to be as much trouble as the stories had made them out to be.</p>
        <p>"I just want a friend." Said the Demon.</p>
        <p>The Suns heart melted as he saw his own loneliness reflected within the Demon. (Metaphorically speaking of course, no Sun would be able to survive with a melted heart!)</p></div>

        <p>But before he had the chance to reply the towns people appeared out of their houses. Their faces were bright red with rage; it was now ten in the morning and the Sun had left his place in the sky, meaning that they didn't wake up from his sunrise. The people started shouting angrily at him through their megaphones to get back in the sky, where he belonged. (They couldn't get too close to him in fear of burning).</p>
        <p>This made the Sun angry. These people never spent time with him, never appreciated him. They wanted him to be alone in the sky! They were worse than the Demon who stood before him, trying to be his friend.</p>
        <p>So instead of returning to his post in the sky the Sun swooped up the Demon and travelled through space, further and further away...</p>
        <p>Past the planets and the stars, past Jupiter and Mars, until Earth was only a tiny star away.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Together they formed a bond that neither of them had experienced before.</p>
        <p>True friendship.</p>
        <p>They even thought of merging 'Sun' and 'Demon' together to form some sort of super name! But quickly realised how ridiculous this would sound.</p>
        <p>Here in space, playing golf with various planet craters and searching for long lost alien species they could finally be happy.</p>
        <p>The lonesome was no more.</p>
        <p>Until a small space ship appeared from Earth. The Sun sighed, they're going to be very angry with him now; he hadn't been at his post in the sky for such a long time!</p>
        <p>But to his surprise that's not what emerged from the space ship.</p>
        <p>Instead came figures with tails and horns, quite like his friends but much larger and more menacing. These must be Head Demons.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sheet odd img p11">

      <div class="sheet even p12">
        <p>"Well done! You've finally proved your worth, and to think we were worried that you didn't have it in you!"</p>
        <p>The Sun looked at his friend in puzzlement. He thought his friend was different from these creatures of evil, spitting fire and coughing up blood as they driften closer towards them.</p>
        <p>"It's time to go home now. We have much to celebrate!" The Head Demon's voice boomed as he grabbed the Sun's only friend by the collar.</p>
        <p>"Wait!" Sun panicked, "What's going on? Who even are you?"</p>
        <p>The Head Demon twisted his head the full way around to address the Sun with glowing red eyes.</p>
        <p>"I am Lucifer! And this is the heir to my firey thrown, my son."</p>
        <p>The Sun recoiled in pain, how could his friend not have told him? But his chance to ask had gone as his friend was being dragged into the space ship; head down in guilt, horns showing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sheet odd img p13">

        <p>"He has managed to fulfill what we could not. Can you not hear the sweet sound of suffering? People have died without you around and my son has made sure to keep you busy enough not to notice!" A laughter errupted from Lucifer's mouth, so evil that the planets around him started to crumble, as he retreated back toward Earth.</p>
        <p>Left alone the Sun could hear the cries of despair, the pleads for help; for him. The Demon was not his friend, these poor people were all along!</p>
        <p>Full of disdain for the Demon who abused his trust, he zoomed towards Earth as fast as he could until he was greeted by a great cheer of appreciation.</p>
        <p>The Sun was shocked by what the earth had turned into. Everything was snow and ice, people everywhere were on the verge of becoming living icicles!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sheet even p16">
        <p>That's when it hit him; the Sun was not alone. He was the most needed thing on the whole of Earth, without him nobody would survive!</p>
        <p>This warmed his heart so much that within minutes the Earth was back to it's normal temperature leaving the ice to turn into water and trickle away as if it were never there in the first place.</p>
        <p>"We're so sorry for leaving you alone in the sky Sun. We'll keep you company from now on. Because, we love you!" The people of Earth shouted through their megaphones, realising their silly mistake and understanding that, just like them, the Sun needed friends too.</p>
        <p>The Sun was happy.</p>
        
      </div>

        <p>Meanwhile, below the soil and the rocks, the celebrations of death had come to an end and the Sun's no longer friend lay in the fire pit with scorched skin and bloody eyes.</p>
        <p>He had been crowned King of the Underworld </p>
        <p>But this wasn't what he had intended, so he punished himself in this pit. Burning his skin until it starts to heal and the repeatedly burning it all over again.</p>
        <p>This physical pain helped to wash out the pain that he felt within his 'black' heart.He had meant for none of this. His intentions from the start had been pure, if that can even be said of a Demon.</p>
        <p>Now he has been crowned King; the King of lonliness.</p>
        <p>All he wanted was a friend.</p>
        <p>But Demon's can't have friends.</p>
